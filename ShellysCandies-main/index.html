                Michelle began cooking for others when she married in 1983. Taking care of her husband was just the start
                of her baking journey. Soon, they had 2 kids. Then 3, and eventually 5 little rugrats were running around.
                A lot was changing in Shelly's life — but one thing that has remained constant to this day is her simple yet
                delicious recipe for her homemade toffee that has become a highly coveted treat at many family gatherings.
                Her children look forward to it every year, and now so do her customers!
            </p>

            <p>
                Shelly's candy was a hit at the "Chocolate Lover's Affair" event in Pocatello, Idaho in 2023, where she gave
                away free samples and sold over 10 lb of delicious homemade toffee.
